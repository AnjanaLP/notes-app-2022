# Notes App

A client-side app using JavaScript and Jest for testing. It allows a user to manage a list of their 'to-do' notes.

It shows how JavaScript code:
* is built and loaded by a web browser
* can manipulate the page content and handle user interaction
* can make HTTP requests without reloading the page (using fetch)

The app has been build using a  minimal code structure for separation of concerns.
