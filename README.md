# Notes App

A client-side single-page app written in pure JavaScript to allow a user to manage a list of their 'to-do' notes. Built in a test-driven manner using Jest. Uses esbuild as the build tool.

It shows how JavaScript code:
* is built and loaded by a web browser
* can manipulate the page content and handle user interaction
* can make HTTP requests without reloading the page (using fetch)

The app has been built using a  minimal code structure for separation of concerns to keep the code clean and well designed.
